# code-refactor
##Description
--I undertook it to gauge my progress and what I've learned in HTML and CSS.

-I optimized CSS rules to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
-Images were appropriately described with alt attributes.
-Selector names in the CSS file were aligned with class names in the HTML.
-I organized the HTML code according to standard and Semantic HTML practices.
-Detailed comments were added to clarify actions taken in both HTML and CSS files.
